## Points worth to note
- I have spent around 8 hours and started working on Monday.
- NgRx boilerplate took significant time to setup.
- Developer with mobile first approach.

## Things I will do, if I have more time
- Implement TS path aliases.
- Would make some changes in store structure and use of NgRx entities.
- The length logic to fetch all moview can be more sophisticated.
- More focus on UI/UX.
- Add unit tests to the project. In production apps, I always prefer to write unit tests.

## Starting the local development server
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

```` sh
npm install
npm run dev
````
